Title: An R package to uncover high-resolution protein-DNA interactions
        in ChIP-exo replicates
Author: Pedro Madrigal <pm12@sanger.ac.uk>
Description: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates. The cumulative Skellam distribution function (package 'skellam') is used to detect significant normalized count differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs). Irreproducible discovery rate for overlapping peak-pairs across biological replicates is estimated using the package 'idr'.
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), IRanges
