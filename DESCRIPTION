Description: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates.
        The cumulative Skellam distribution function (package
        'skellam') is used to detect significant normalised count
        differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs).
        Irreproducible discovery rate (IDR) for overlapping peak-pairs across
        biological replicates is estimated using the package 'idr'.
